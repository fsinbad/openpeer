# TODO

-   add Jest tests
-   remove pages/testtg.tsx later

## TG and WhatsApp

1. update the API, which requires a migration thing
2. Is there some connection rigamarole with whatsapp too?

3. Modify the existing updateUser function or create a new endpoint specifically for Telegram data if needed.
4. Ensure proper validation and sanitization of the new Telegram-related data.
5. Update any relevant database migrations to include the new fields.
6. If necessary, add new API routes to handle Telegram-specific operations.
7. Update the API documentation to reflect these changes.
8. Implement proper error handling for Telegram-related operations.

At what point do I absolutely need to set up the staging environment?

-   run the API locally or what?
-   how to set up the staging stuff with Cloud66?
